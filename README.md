# Digital Deadman's Switch (DDS) Information Vault
This contains the code to run the _vault_ portion of the deadman's suite of tools.

The vault ensures the longevity, validity, and  of the information stored. Through use of GPG signing,
as well as data sharding and git like tracking of changes.

The idea is that the vault will be **replicated** among many shards so a bad actor cannot easily disable, delete or 
destroy the information you have.
